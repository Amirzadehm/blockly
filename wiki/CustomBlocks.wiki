#summary Overview of creating custom blocks.
#labels Phase-Implementation,Featured

This document is aimed at developers who wish to create new blocks within Blockly.  It is assumed that one has a local copy of Blockly which one can edit, one is generally familiar with Blockly's usage, and one has a basic understanding of !JavaScript or some similar language.

= Introduction =

Blockly comes with a large number of pre-defined blocks.  Everything from mathematical functions to looping structures.  However, in order to interface with an external application, one must create custom blocks to form an API.  For example, when creating a drawing program, one might need to create a "_draw circle of radius R_" block.

In most cases the easiest approach is to just find a really similar block which already exists, copy it, and modify it as needed.  The following documentation is for those who need more help.  If all else fails, post in the [http://groups.google.com/group/blockly support newsgroup].

== Define Block ==

The first step is to create a block; specifying its shape, labels, and connection points.  This is done in the `language/` directory.

== Code Generation ==

The second step is to create the generator code to export the new block to a programming language (such as !JavaScript, Dart, or Python).  This is done in the `generators/` directory.
