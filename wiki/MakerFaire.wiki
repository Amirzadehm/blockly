#Tutorial for Blockly users who want to write programs that help Pegman navigate the Maze.

*Introduction to Blockly*

Blockly is a new programming language made of "blocks" that look like Jigsaw puzzle pieces.

*Activity*

Write a Blockly program that leads Pegman through the maze to his destination. 

*See How it Works*

Click the *Run Program* button that appears underneath the maze, and see Pegman move forward one square. This is because the *move forward* block already appears in the workspace on the right.

*Get Pegman to His Destination*

1. In the *Blocks* menu, click *Maze*.

You'll see all the Maze blocks. You'll only need the *move forward*, *turn left*, and *turn right* blocks.

2. Click a block to place it in the workspace. 

*Tip*: If you add the same block again, the new block is placed on top of the block that is already there. That's okay because you can drag blocks out of the stack later. Just don't forget they're there!

3. Drag and drop your blocks where you want them. Your program will run the blocks from top to bottom. 

4. Click the *Reset* button under the maze. Now click the *Run Program* button that appears. 

Watch Pegman go through the maze to reach his destination.

*Make Your Program Better*

1. Notice that your program has a pattern.


*Play Around*

Make Pegman go through the maze backwards.

Make Pegman go through the loop.

*See and Notice*
