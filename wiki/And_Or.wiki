=The *And Or* Block=

To access the *And Or* Block, click *Logic*.

|| *Option* || *Description* ||
|| *and* || Use this with two other blocks when you want the program to do something when both conditions exist at the same time. For example, *wall to the right?* and *wall to the left?*. Then you can tell Pegman to move forward instead of turn.||
|| *or* ||Use this when you want the program to do something when either condition exists.||

*Note*: The *And Or* block fits with other blocks, like the *True* block, that it might not be useful with.
