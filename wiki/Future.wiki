 * Improved variable rename dialog.
 * Fire events on changes.
 * IE support (definitely 10, maybe earlier?).
 * Comprehensive testing.
 * 40 (human) languages.
 * Arduino code generation.
 * Tree toolbox.
 * Dynamic addition/deletion from toolbox.
 * Frequently used category.
 * Multi-line strings.
 * Colour selection.
 * Date/Time selection.
 * Icons for context menu.
 * Improved shadow on blocks.

 * Local variables.
 * Cursor control for accessibility.
 * Debugging hooks.
