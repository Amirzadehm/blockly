= Near-term goals =

 * Non-modal mutator bubbles.
 * Trash can contents bubble.
 * Colour selection.
 * More blocks (e.g. substring).

= Medium-term goals =

 * Improved variable rename dialog.
 * Better tablet support.
 * IE support (definitely 10, maybe earlier?).
 * Comprehensive testing.
 * 40 (human) languages.
 * Tree toolbox.
 * Dynamic addition/deletion from toolbox.
 * Frequently used category.
 * Multi-line strings.
 * Date/Time selection.
 * Icons for context menu.
 * Per-block documentation.
 * Improved shadow on blocks.

= Long-term goals =

 * Zoom.
 * Multiple workspaces.
 * Local variables.
 * Cursor control for accessibility.
 * Debugging hooks.
 * Search.

Let us know what your priorities are.  Also, Blockly is open source so if there is a feature you need then you are free to work on it.
