#Help for the Maze *True_False* block.

|| *Option* || *Description* ||
|| *true* || Finds out if something is true. If it is, the program will do whatever you tell it to do next.||
|| *false* ||Finds out if something is false. If it is, the program will do whatever you tell it to do next.||

*Tip*: To tell the program what to do next, combine the *True_False* block with these other blocks:

 * [http://code.google.com/p/google-blockly/wiki/If If] 
 * [http://code.google.com/p/google-blockly/wiki/Repeat Repeat]
 * [http://code.google.com/p/google-blockly/wiki/And_Or And_Or]

You can write statements like:

 * *If* true, *then* move forward. 
 * *Else if* false, *then* move backward. 
 * *Repeat while* true.
 * *Repeat until* false.

*Note*: For the maze, there is no good example that uses the *True_False* block with the *And_Or* block. However, the *And_Or* block is useful for other programs.
