#Help for the Maze block "True" and "False".

|| *Option* || *Description* ||
|| *true* || Finds out if something is true. If it is, the program will do whatever you tell it do next.||
|| *false* ||Finds out if something is false. If it is, the program will do whatever you tell it do next.||

*Tip*: To tell the program what to do next, combine this block with these other blocks:

[http://code.google.com/p/google-blockly/wiki/If If] 
[http://code.google.com/p/google-blockly/wiki/Repeat Repeat]
[http://code.google.com/p/google-blockly/wiki/And And]

You can write statements like:

 *If true, move forward. 
 *Else if false, move backward. 
 *Repeat while true.

*Note*: For the maze, there is no good example of using the *True* and *False* block with the *And* block. However, the *And* block is useful for other programs.
