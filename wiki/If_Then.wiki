#labels Control
=The *If Then* Block=

To access the *If Then* Block, click *Control*.

|| *Option* || *Description* ||
|| *if* || Finds out if something is true. If it is, the program will do whatever you tell it to do next.||
|| *then* ||Finds out if something is false. If it is, the program will do whatever you tell it to do next.||
|| *else if* ||Finds out if something is false. If it is, the program will do whatever you tell it to do next.||
|| *else* ||Finds out if something is false. If it is, the program will do whatever you tell it to do next.||


*Tip*: To tell the program what to do next, combine the *True False* block with these other blocks:

 * [http://code.google.com/p/google-blockly/wiki/If If] 
 * [http://code.google.com/p/google-blockly/wiki/Repeat Repeat]
 * [http://code.google.com/p/google-blockly/wiki/And_Or And_Or]

You can write statements like:

 * *If* true, *then* move forward. 
 * *Else if* false, *then* move backward. 
 * *Repeat while* true.
 * *Repeat until* false.

*Note*: For the maze, there is no good example that uses the *True False* block with the *And Or* block. However, the *And Or* block is useful for other programs.
