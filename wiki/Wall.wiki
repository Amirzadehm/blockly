#Help for the Maze block "wall ahead?", "wall behind?", "wall to the right?", and "wall to the left?"


<screenshot1> <screenshot2>

|| *Option* || *Description* ||
||wall *ahead*? ||Finds out if there is a wall one square ahead of Pegman.||
||wall *behind*?  ||Finds out if there is a wall one square behind Pegman.||
||wall *to the right*? ||Finds out if there is a wall on Pegman's right.||
||wall *to the left*? ||Finds out if there is a wall Pegman's left.||

*Tip*: Use the "Wall" block with another block, like the "If...Then" block, to move Pegman depending on where the wall is. For example, *if* there is a wall ahead, *then* move backward.
